Problem
Blind or visually impaired individuals often face challenges navigating web pages, especially when it comes to understanding the structure, content, and functionality of a website.
Solution
Develop a system that provides audio guidance and feedback to help blind users navigate web pages effectively. This system will use a combination of screen reading, voice commands, and audio descriptions to enhance the web browsing experience.
Target Audience
The primary target audience includes blind and visually impaired individuals who use screen readers to navigate the web. Secondary users could include developers looking to make their websites more accessible and inclusive.
Reusability
The core components of this project, such as the custom action for extracting and describing web content, can be adapted for various applications, including educational tools for learning web accessibility, accessibility testing, and enhancing other assistive technologies.
Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to promote digital inclusivity and empower visually impaired individuals by making web navigation more intuitive and accessible. This can significantly improve their ability to access information, perform online tasks, and participate in the digital world.
